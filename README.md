When we look up at the starry sky, what comes into view is an endless void. Beyond the void lies the universe that we have not yet explored. We are full of curiosity about the universe, curious about what it is like, and curious about whether there are other life forms in the universe; At the same time, we also marvel at the greatness of life. In the vast universe, life was born on Earth. Although life is only a few short years, it conveys the meaning of life, which is inheritance. The continuous continuation and inheritance of life is the true essence of life. Cherishing the present, respecting life, and protecting the Earth are urgent, just as it is for us and our descendants to look up to this starry sky in the future.
